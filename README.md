# vimrc
My VIM environment

# Installation
* Create `.vim` folder in `$HOME` if it doesn't already exist.
* Install Vundle plugin as per the instructions at https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim
* Copy `.vimrc` from this repository to `$HOME` folder.
* Start `vim` and run `:PluginInstall` for Vundle to do its magic. (Vundle clones all the defined plugins from github to `~/.vim/bundle`) 
* Follow instructions in https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe/ to compile YCM with the preferred language support.

Done.
